The flow of the request created when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter:

DNS resolution: Your browser sends a request to the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.

Request hitting server IP on the appropriate port: Once the DNS resolution is complete, your browser sends a request to the IP address of the Google server using the appropriate port (usually port 443 for HTTPS traffic).

Traffic is encrypted: The traffic between your browser and the Google server is encrypted using the SSL/TLS protocol to ensure that the data remains confidential and secure.

Traffic goes through a firewall: The request goes through a firewall, which acts as a barrier between the public internet and the private network of the Google server, and controls the traffic flow according to security policies.

Request is distributed via a load balancer: The request is distributed to multiple web servers via a load balancer, which evenly distributes traffic among the servers to optimize performance and prevent overload.

Web server answers the request by serving a web page: One of the web servers receives the request and responds by serving a web page containing the Google search interface.

Application server generates the web page: The web page is generated by an application server, which runs the software code that handles user requests and generates dynamic content.

Application server requests data from the database: The application server retrieves the necessary data from the Google database to generate the web page, such as search results or personalized information.
